            "53\t0\t0.979722797870636\t\"Whom Can We Trust If No One Is Trustworthy?<br>One of my favorite quips from Mark Twain’s The Adventures of Tom Sawyer is when Tom is defined as “a glittering hero…the pet of the old, the envy of the young,” and there were “some that believed that he would be President, yet, if he escaped hanging.” With these few words, Twain captured the essence of leadership in our world. Those who get to the top are the fiercest, most determined, and most ruthless. Today, the latter quality has become so intense that we can no longer believe our leaders, and certainly not trust them to have our best interest in mind.<br>I am not accusing any leader in particular, or even leaders as a whole. It is simply that in an egoistic world, where people vie to topple one another on their way to the top, the one at the top is clearly the one who trampled over and knocked down more people than anyone else. Concisely, to get to the top in an egoistic world you have to be the biggest egoist.<br>So how do we know whom to trust? We don’t know and we cannot know. All we know is that we are in the dark.<br>In a culture of unhinged selfishness, any conspiracy theory seems reasonable, while truth is nowhere to be found. When every person who says or writes something is trying to promote some hidden agenda, you have no way of knowing who is right, what really happened, or if anything happened at all.<br>The only way to get some clarity in the news and goodwill from our leaders is to say “Enough!” to our current system and build something entirely independent. The guiding principle of such a system should be “information only,” no commentary. Commentary means that information has already been skewed. Information means saying only what happened, as much as possible, not why, and not who is to blame and who we should praise.<br>Concurrently, we must begin a comprehensive process of self-teaching. We have to know not only what is happening, but why we skew and distort everything. In other words, we have to know about human nature and how it inherently presents matters according to its own subjective view, which caters to one’s own interest. To “clear” ourselves from that deformity, we must learn how to rise above our personal interest and develop an equally favorable attitude toward others. This is our only guarantee that our interpretation of things will be even and correct.<br>Once we achieve such an attitude, we will discover that the bad things we see in our world reflect our own, internal wickedness. Our ill-will toward others creates a world where ill-will governs, and so the world is filled with wickedness and cruelty. Therefore, all we need in order to create positive leadership—and to generally eliminate ill-will from the world—is to generate goodwill within us. When we nurture goodwill toward others, we will fill the world with goodwill. As a result, the world will fill with kindness and compassion. By changing ourselves, we will create a world that is opposite from the world we have created through our desires to govern, patronize, and often destroy other people.\"\n",

            "279\t1\t0.6693355441093445\t\"The thing about the Republican Party they All are Croupt and Crooked. Not one Word or Phase is believable from them. They are Liars and they protect Evil 😈😈 as with Trump&#39;s Impeachment Twice. The Democrats proved without a doubt Trump were Guilty but to convict Trump they have to Convict themselves and that will never happen. Impeachment protect Your Country Not the President. I don&#39;t support Liz Cheney but she has stood firm against Trump and many of the Republicans that has protected Trump but these Republicans has turned against her for defending America and I will praise her for that . American is in the Dangerous and Greatest Time of it&#39;s Life. Republicans Hates Democracy, and they have tried everyway to Destroy it but they are continuing to do so. Republicans are America&#39;s Greatest Enemy.  If Republicans gains Control of America&#39;s all three Branches of Government by 2024 We the sane Americans will lose Our Democracy for a Dictatorship. Today Trump praised and endorsed the Dictator (Viktor Orbán) of Hungary. Trump wants to be the Dictator of America and if the Voters grants this by their Votes or Republicans overthrows America&#39;s Constitution it will happen. As Trump tried it on January 6th, 2021 and now Republican States are Changing Voter Laws and Voters Right and if the States Republicans Control doesn&#39;t like the Votes outcomes they want to refuse the winner. Since Republican voted in these Republican Justices of the Supreme Court they have striped the Voters Rights of Republican Controlled States that was passed earlier in law. Unless these Republicans Justices&#39; are not removed from Office these Republicans will Destroy American and the Rights of All Americans that doesn&#39;t support Republican Views meaning Dictatorship. If you are receiving Social Security, Medicare or State Medicaid  you can kiss that good bye because Republicans hates any Social Program that helps the poor or Middle Class Workers. <br><br>I hope everyone can see why Trump and the Republicans involved in the Riot at the US Capital must be Executed they must be removed from power forever. Unless we Stop the Corruption of the Republicans we want have America much longer. It the Will and the intentions of All Republicans to take over America and create a Dictatorship. Unless We Stop Trump and these Republicans our America is doomed. <br><br>I don&#39;t understand Why Merritt Garland hasn&#39;t arrested Any of these People as Trump, Jim Jordan, MT Greene, Lauren Boebart, Paul Gosar, Andy Biggs, Rudy Giuliana, Jeffery Clark, John Eastman and others. I think Garland should  be Replaced as Attorney General. We need a Attorney General as a Rottweiler Dog but we have AG as a Poodle with All bark with NO Bite and the Republicans knows this. <br><br>If I had a voice at CNN I would encourage them to fire Scott Jennings he is a sorry Ingorant Republican that doesn&#39;t care for America but Only these Republican Fools. Anyone that voted for Trump after 4 years seeing his Deeds and Actions is total Stupid and a embarrassment to CNN. Fire Scott Jennings. I dislike his attitude his answers and I don&#39;t like his Republican views.\n",
