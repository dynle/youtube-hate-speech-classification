The outside world knows little about these elusive characters, and the honour of the Witzeman. For those who have ever been a Witzeman, it has been said to have been a great honour, although the qualities needed for the job have never been disclosed. A person may not now they were a Witzeman for many years, until they are called by former Witzemans via dreams. Associates of the Witzeman are known to be a certain Babe Cool or the much lesser known Witzewoman.  The Present Witzeman is an 11-year-old boy namely Benjamin Woods, who is said to have become a Witzeman after he felt this 'awesome radiance in his top-right bumcheek'. He has not told a great number of people his testimony, but has promised to do so in years to come.                             History The present world has only come enlightned with the knowledge of the Witzeman in present years, because former Witzemen have not been so public about the honour, to abide with the formality and conservativism in their time. The term 'Witzeman' is a compound word of the adjective Witze and 'man', witze being an 11th century term for 'a person of extreme humour and radiant intelligence'. Unfortuneatly, Witze is also sometimes associated with bad wind, for unspeakable reasons.                         Proper History As early as the 14th century, Witzemen were considered outcasts, and young children were encouraged to poke them with sticks. This led to the 1st Witzeman Rebellion of 1555 when the current Witzeman and his followers attempted a coup to take over the local Council chess team. This rebellion further disgraced the Witzeman, as he and his followers were embarassingly pronounced 'gaga' at a Government meeting that year. The period from here to the early 1900s was a dark time in the Witzemans history. However good times were to come for the Witzeman. Many normal people took part in mass demonstrations and protests for the Witzeman in the 1980s, building up to a great moment in the history...the Great Rebellion of 1988. This was when several Witzeman sprinted round the Visitors Gallery of the House of Commons, wearing clown masks, but otherwise completely naked. This was thought to be an act of circambulation. However many people who witnessed this shocking behaviour, were 'mentally, spiritually, and emotionallly scarred for life'. This group of people included many young children who were forced to go to asylums in a state of mental instability, suffering from trauma. It was at this time that the Government finally took positive action for the Witzeman. In 1990, a bill of rights for the Witzeman was signed, stating all Witzemen were allowed to do as they pleased. Although this was a formal agreement, many journalists viewed it as a letter of submission from the Government to the Witzeman, as the behaviour of the Witzeman and his followers became more and more twisted.\\n\",\n",

There we did Trappist, Abbey, and Foreign.  Foreign includes all non-Belgium examples.  This way the article is an article in an encyclopedia, not a list.  People can find lists anywhere, and the article should reference this.  Also, the style statistics are bad.  When you say style statistics, it sounds like a prescription, not a description.

We have our own ethnicity, and we shouldn\\'t be forced to be called \"\"Christian arabs\"\". If a Christian European is born in the middle east, should he be called a \"\"Christian arab\"\" because of that reason alone? Please understand, they are Syriac Christians (i.e. of Assyrian ancestry), and most of them speak Aramaic, though a lot of them are forgetting it. As someone who speaks Aramaic, you should respect this fact, and not appease muslims who want to call everyone arabs just because they\\'re in the middle east.

LOL, the [[Reformist Party (Serbia)|Reformist Party] is having another go (the 20th very last on the parliamentary election, winning less votes than notable to actually be mentioned). )  By the way, here's something very little people have figured out - the new Constitution of Serbia has been brought to enable Kosovo' secession. The 1990 Constitution barred that as a possibility, and after the Kumanovo Military-Technical Agreement was signed between NATO and FRY the SRS broke its coalition with SPS and the government collapsed, causing new elections - because that was unconstitutional, as an act of highest treason, enough to be tried from maximum sentence (which the Radicals demanded from then to his death, to have a trial in Serbia, and to be tried for treason among other reasons). This constitution releases the authorities from that weight, and they won't have to go to prison if they recognize any form of further loss of sovereignty in Kosovo. ;)   15\\n\",\n",

The information section is unnecessarily loaded with history and detailed geography, which makes it not only uninteresting, but also repetitive.

That is not strictly geography, and belongs in the introduction. Climate belongs towards the latter part of the page, perhaps before toursim. Regions and cities is not such an interesting combination.

I don't know if this is the section Nelson was charged under in the federal case, but if anyone could explain this, I would appreciate it.  You can argue whether or not the outcome of the state murder trial was justified, that's really not my concern here, since it's a dead letter.  I'm concerned about whether the subsequent civil rights prosecution was legal.  If the state murder acquittal was a miscarriage of justice, it's not the first time.  Look at Issei Sagawa.  Part of having a mature understanding of this sort of thing is to realize that the criminal justice system isn't perfect, and that it is inevitable that innocent people will be convicted, and that guilty people will be acquited, from time to time.  That's the price you pay for having a legal system; in the end someone has to make the decision, and sometimes they may not necessarily get it right.  I don't think it's going out on a limb to say that the Sagawa case is completely beyond all reasonable belief.\\n\",\n",

The consensus, developed by respected scholars of fascism who write in a manner which is not bias to any interest group such as Roger Griffin, Hamish McDonald, Roger Eatwell and Zeev Sternhell all recongise fascism as a \"\"Third Way\"\" as the references show.  The only dissenters I\\'m aware of who seem to think fascism has absoutely no leftist connections and is merely a radical right system are street level socialists who want to put as much distance between the movements as possible.

              " '0\\t\"  66.185.85.80\\'s rant  Presently, we are witnessing  an open war against Croatian Dinaric culture.  Croatian Left often portrays this culture as \"\"primitive\"\" and \"\"rural\"\" (even \"\"fashist\"\") being  in  service of Conservative HDZ party. Croatian writer Predrag Raos, for instance, \"\"performed\"\" on gusle instrument in Zagreb on several occasions this year (2004) with only one intention - to ridicule the same instrument and its rich poetic tradition.   Another \"\"apostle\"\" of Croatian Left - Miljenko Jergović - refers to his political opponents on the Right as \"\"gusle players\"\".   Some even claim the Serbian origin of Croatian Dinaric culture following the line of traditional greater Serbian propagabda (all štokavian people and their culture are Serbian). However, Croatian Dinaric folklore and its rich gusle heritage is primarly Croatian. Dalmatian costal region has been historically associated with this culture. For example, the first written document about the most popular folk hero of traditional gusle music, Marko Kraljević, is associated with Dalmatian island Hvar through Petar Hektorović\\'s book \"\"Ribanje i ribarsko prigovaranje\"\", 1568). Also, the first historical document which mentioned gusle player and its instrument originated in  Dubrovnik (1547). Even now, a contemporary Croatian writer (born in Dubrovnik) Stijepo Mijović Kočan tells us a story about his uncle (also from Dubrovnik area) who could memorize numerous gusle songs (Stijepo Mijović Kočan: Gusle, Glasnik, May 25, 1992, p. 42). Dubrovnik is also a home of Anica Begin (born Kalafatović, 1816), a daughter of famous gusle player Ante. Although illiterate, she was able to recite by heart an immense number of gusle songs, some of which were recorded in antology of Croatian folk poetry.    Not far from Dubrovnik, another coastal city - Makarska – was  also a bastion of Croatian gusle music. Actually, this region could be considered the Capital of all Croatian gusle players. This Mediterranean area  also gave birth to  Andrija Kačić Miošić (18th century Catholic priest), who is  viewed as the father of all gusle players of Croatia and beyond. To honour Kačić\\'s work, Ivan Meštrović, the most famous Croatian sculptor, built a sculpture in America showing Kačić in his priestly clothes  playing gusle instrument.    In addition to Kačić, Makarska Littoral produced a great many other followers of Croatian gusle music. According to dr. fra Karlo Jurišić (who quotes the work of Croatian folklorist Stipan Banović), Zaostrog alone  produced a great number of gusle players starting with Stipan Kosović-Kudrić (1771-1818) and culminating with the most known Mate Banović – Trliš (1844-1915).  As for Dalmatian women, they didn\\'t play gusle (it\\'s    considered   a male activity only), yet they were actively involved in spreading  gusle music  by  imitating its sound.   Olinko Delorko, the researcher of  Dalmatian  folk poetry in the 1960s, states in his book Ljuba Ivanova (1969) that most of his Dalmatian folk poetry collection was obtained by  women, especially the ones from the island of Hvar.   The Zadar Littoral also witnessed strong gusle tradition. English writer Maude M. Holbach, travelling through Zadar region in the first decade of 20th century  states in her book  \"\"Dalmatia: The Land Where East Meets West\"\" that the gusle was the national instrument of the region. As for Dinaric dances, which took place at markets and certain festivals, they  are very picturesque and interesting, and worth going a long way to see, being a survival of ancient custom probably unique in Europe (p.54)  This admiration for Dinaric folk music, particularly gusle, was seen in both Dalmatian Litteral and  Hinterland.  Matija Murko, the researcher of this literary/music forms,  had reported   that during his trips  through Dalmatia in the 1930s, he saw a child, barely three years old playing gusle (Eduard Osredečki: “Hrvatske narodne junačke pjesme”, Željezno-Beč, p. 9)  Now, lets  take a look at  the names of some Dalmatian sports clubs and organizations: Hajduk, Junak, Gusar, Alkar, Uskok, sinjska alka, etc. What do they have in common? Of course, their names refer to the heroic gusle tradition of the region.   Having this in mind, one wonders why this proud Croatian heritage has become almost  extinct.  Why do we have so few gusle players today ? Is it a  result of  unavoidable urbanization  of  modern Croatian society where peasant culture is being considered  inferior to global  rock \\'n\\' roll  culture ? If so, why has tamburitza music of Northern Croatia  gained wide acceptance from the Croatian establishment while its  Dinaric counterpart (gusle music) is looked upon with suspicion and  open hatre\\n',\n",

In addition, the rotating skyhook is in fact deemed \"\"not engineeringly feasible using presently available materials\"\".\"\"  Regarding:  In addition, the rotating skyhook is in fact deemed \"\"not engineeringly feasible using presently available materials\"\"  That statement appears to come from Ref [3] on page 10.  The full quote is  \"\"If the mass of the tether alone started to exceed 200 times the mass of the payload, then that was an indication the particular scenario being considered was not engineeringly feasible using presently available materials, although the application might become feasible in the near future as better materials become available with higher tensile strengths at higher operational temperatures.\"\"  It then goes on to say  \"\"As we shall see, presently available commercial materials will suffice to make the HASTOL tethers needed. The primary message we want to leave with the Reader is: “We don\\'t need magic materials like ‘Buckminster-Fuller-carbon-nanotubes’ to make the space tether facility for a HASTOL system. Existing materials will do.”\"\"  So it would appear that you misread your reference.  The tether mass of 200 times mass of the payload mass is the upper limit to the problem.  Systems where the tether mass is less than 200 times the payload mass can be built with \"\"presently available commercial materials.\"\"  To further reinforce this the Conclusion to the report states  \"\"The fundamental conclusion of the Phase I HASTOL study effort is that the concept is technically feasible. We have evaluated a number of alternate system configurations that will allow hypersonic air-breathing vehicle technologies to be combined with orbiting, spinning space tether technologies to provide a method of moving payloads from the surface of the Earth into Earth orbit. For more than one HASTOL architecture concept, we have developed a design solution using existing, or near-term technologies. We expect that a number of the other HASTOL architecture concepts will prove similarly technically feasible when subjected to detailed design studies. The systems are completely reusable and have the potential of drastically reducing the cost of Earth-to-orbit space access.\"\"  Regarding: \"\"but the skyhook is not competitive with other rotating tether concepts.\"\" and   \"\"A 2000 Boeing report on the possibillity of combining skyhooks with hypersonic planes concluded that \"\"In general, the non-spinning tether HyperSkyhook concept does not look competitive with the spinning tether concepts.\"\".\"\"  The full quote is:  \"\"HyperSkyhook  In 1995 Zubrin proposed the “Hypersonic Skyhook” as a solution to the mismatch between the attainable atmospheric speeds of a hypersonic airplane and the orbital speeds of space tethers.

I can not do this job because I always connect from \"\"filtered\"\" institutional net-access, and following those steps could result in new, undesired, controversial \"\"truncation\"\" of words by the software. I do not want that happenning.  Could you please follow the instructions in the link I provided?. Thank you.    Randroide answers to New reference by Burgas00     At last we agree on something!...of course that the new section is a good idea: The false \"\"suicidal\"\" terrorists from PRISA will also be included there.   Come oooooon, boys, start writing that section. I do not want all the kudos for myself: The new proposed article is, by now, an effort made only by me.   But remember: NPOV and sources, all the sources. Just like me citing \"\"El País\"\" in the section about the doubts about the genuineness of the 13th bomb. Cheers       Indeed, a good point. And all the remarks in COPE too. And the \"\"moral certitudes\"\" of Mariano Rajoy published in El Mundo.    I agree with you 100%, Larean.    What Randroide omits to mention on the section about the 13th bomb is that he only added balancing references when I insisted that he do so, the original version he created was entirely POV, as is much of the rest of the proposed article. Also, all the sources that he added from El Pais are only available to subscribers - NPOV it is not.     You are right, Southofwatford, in your \"\"Randroide omits...\"\" section.  If you have not subscription to \"\"El País\"\", I am sorry but that´s your problem. My \"\"institutional\"\" access also has some advantages, like paid access to \"\"El País\"\" (and many, many other publications and books). That´s one of the reasons for my exclusive use of \"\"filtered\"\" Internet accesss: It´s much easier for me to work here due to the easy availability of sources.  Do you see?. The truncation of words is offsett (I think) by better sources.  BTW, if you write under a \"\"Randroide answers\"\" section you are: Invading \"\"my\"\" space. I do not mind, really. But you are doing it. Risking new truncations on your messages. To avoid this, please write OUTSIDE \"\"Randroide answers\"\" sections.  If you think that the proposed article is POV, work in it to make it NPOV. The article is not \"\"mine\"\".    I\\'ll take the risk of you truncating the reply and put it here, it\\'s very short. The issue is not whether I subscribe to El País, its whether the people who read an article in the English Wikipedia subscribe to it. All sources used should be accessible to all readers of the article, putting in a source that readers will not be able to see just so you can claim the article is NPOV is, to my mind, completely unreasonable.      All sources used should be accessible to all readers of the article  Very funny, Southofwatford.   I am going to follow this joke of yours.  Please propose also the deletion of all books as sources, because, did you know?, there is always someone without this or that book. Delete all references to TV or radio stations, because that user in Brazil has no TV and no radio at home. Delete all the references in spanish, because, did you know?, there are users who know no spanish.  It´s a pleasure to read this kind of funny jokes, really. I had a good laugh.  User:Southofwatford  How strange that you should find it so funny, after all most of the sources we are providing should enable users to find out more information about what is being sourced, so to deliberately choose sources that require those users to pay to see the information is not funny, it\\'s simply bizarre. Equally, in the English Wikipedia I would argue that choosing a Spanish or other foreign language source when an equally valid source exists in English does not make sense, except perhaps to those who are too busy laughing - your cynicism is evident in your response.   08:3\\n',\n",

              " '0\\tPaleontologists agree that organic remains must be buried quickly so they can be preserved long enough to be come fossilized.  However, the term fossilized is not a very precise term.  There are several factors and metamorphic mineral processes which occur to organic remains that result in what is typically called a fossil.  One major factor concerns what kind of organisms are to be fossilized  vertebrate, invertebrates, radiolarians, sponges, plants, pollen, foot prints, etc.  And multiple processes may include permineralization, recrystalization, carbonization, replacement, dissolving, diagenesis, etc.  Talking about fossilization is a complex issue, however quick burial is not questioned.  The major question is, how long does it take for these processes to work on organic reamins in the environment they are found in?  Experimental taphonomy has resulted in an assortment of remains becoming fossilized by various processes in the lab, which of course implies that given the right conditions, vast ages are not an issue.  The metamorphic processes are ongoing until an equilibrium is met between the chemical enviroument of the burial site and the minerals of the organic remains.  Flood catastrophic geologists do not expect that organic remains buried during the flood were completely fossilized within the one year period of the flood, but rather that there has been some 4000 years for the processes to have been working.  Much more work needs to be done on the taphonomy of organic remains.  Yet, how one interprets even those results will depend upon which world view you choose to believe with.\\n',\n",

If you would like evidence for any of the claims made on the talk, then I will only be too glad to provide. You also failed to provide diffs in your message to me, in regards to which words you\\'re claiming are offesive, perhaps WP:Assume good faith.  The two users constantly harass and follow me to articles making disruptive edits in violation of numerous Wikipedia guidelines (WP:HARASS is just one). For example the removal of third party references from articles which don\\'t suit their POV, without entering an edit summary (considered by Wikipedia guidelines as bad faith and a violation of WP:BLANK). The violation of WP:NEO by adding derogatory neologisms to the articles of organisations who they do not personally agree with, despite being made aware of the policy, despite not having any reference to the said organisation being described with said neologislm and despite the community majority constantly removing the derogatory term.  The same \"\"tag team\"\" practise can be shown to be used against numerous other editors who edit articles on British culture and trad counties, not just against me. Again, if you would like evidence just ask.  It would seem however, looking at the messages on your talkpage above, especially the lovely intertude under \"\"UK mediation\"\" section, that Jza messaged you (somebody he seems very familiar with) in violation of WP:CANVAS. Specifically the section on Wikipedia:CANVAS#Campaigning may interest you.

Just be it is a contraversy page doesn't allow you state lies or add OR, you can list things as misinterpretations of the rules and things like that but it you try to say scouting does this or scouting does that then you need to be sure scouting actually says that.  Even the misinterpretations of the rules need sources.  Just because an editor might misinterprete the rules doesn't mean anyone in mainstream has.  Can you find a source for somewhere where a homosexual youth was removed from the program just for being a openly homosexual youth?  Then insert it.

I’m already out there concerned about this so I’m really outraged to be stereotyped in that way by her because I am a career teacher and yes, when you have a situation where commercialised sex is being pushed without a true eroticism…I’ve been saying this for years, that we have got to a point of meaningless exhibitionism without real eroticism. I’m for eroticism.\"\"   Camille Paglia is a major American social critic. Paglia's academic writing focuses on the role of vibrant dangerous sexuality in human history. Paglia's key importance to sex-positive feminism is not only her writings on sex, but her advocacy of \"\"traditional\"\" values like canon texts. Paglia is somewhat of an intellectual enigma, a conservative and academic feminist, who revels in low and high culture alike and celebrates sexualities disapproved of by mainstream Western culture. Paglia has, in many ways, presented a \"\"respectable\"\" face for pro-sex feminism to the world at large.\"\n",

            "129\t0\t0\t0.902816891670227\t\"== Attributing and classifying of personalities ==  Invitation. Your input to Culture of Lithuania is welcomed.  Some problems of defining personalities or attributing them to certain well-known ideological systems may raise here. I propose a quite liberal variant of it, where definition may not be connected with one certain word. Necessity however to follow certain classifying remains.   My initial ideas on this branch, the ones, concerning period of Lithuanian national Renaissance period: Some artists, writers or other cultural workers of this period are often described as  modernists. This definition is not false, but some more concrete things should be added, some specifics of Lithuania.  We should distinguish leading ideas of the Nat. Renaissance from later modernism, which is more known for us. Cultural aspirations of the later Nat. Ren. may be defined as  modernism in a cultural context of Lithuania. But they accented also expression of Lithuanian cultural heritage, and their expression may be seen as something simply typically  Lithuanian. I mean, that such authors in as  Čiurlionis is seen as modernist in Lithuanian context, but it also (and even more) is a representative of Lithuanian culture, when in European or World-wide context. A parallel  example may be taken from literature of India. Poet  Tagore, well known Nobel price winner is known for us as a representative of culture of India. Making India more understandable and closer for western people is concerned as main his input to Western culture. But in his own country, he was seen as a modernist too, who was changing traditional cultural forms, especially stagnated ones. This way also Lithuanian cultural leaders of the N. Ren. could be seen as modernists, which were broadening cultural forms and changing stagnated ones, in Lithuanian context. They also can be seen as modernists in a wider context, but more for acquainting Western people with Lithuanian culture than for their direct input into Western culture. Čiurlionis is the best example here.  In other way, the later Lithuanian modernists (they depended mostly to later  generation, approximately from 4th decade of the 20th century) concerned themselves part of Western modernistic movement and their main purpose (looking generally) was  to introduce Western European ideas into Lithuanian cultural life (see the table below).  We see two different movements and two different world outlooks here. The problem is, that both movements collaborated, especially their political wings did, and interchange of ideas between them is well seen.

Don't answer the questions beyond that Well, the problem with not answering beyond that is that your example is completely rigged. There are several major fundamental problems here.    First, you completely fail to mention the fact that the intelligence behind ID is quite literally not of this earth. Natural science might look at a honeycomb, see it is built by bees, and then find an odd looking fossilized honeycomb, and theorize that it was made by odd looking bees. That is fundamentally different than saying it was made by something not of this earth. ID has at its core the notion that something OUTSIDE the system we can observe is at cause here. This is not science in any sense of the word, it is mythology. When Paul Bunyan was having a wrestling match with babe his blue ox, they kicked up so much dirt they created the great lakes. No evidence of paul and his ox remain. i mean, really.    Second, natural science takes an approach to knowledge that nothing is known scientific law unless it is irrefutable. Theories must have heavy supporting empirical data to back it up. ID turns this on its head and does an end run around knowledge and plays games with \"\"probabilities\"\". If no one can say how flagella on bacteria could have formed naturally, how in the hell can ID proponents come up with any sort of mathematically accurate PROBABILITY of flagella naturally forming on bacteria? If you don't understand it, you can't do statistics on it. ID jumps right over that hurdle and takes anything that doesn't have a complete, detailed, natural explanation and jams in their own statistics that say \"\"well, it's so improbable for this to happen, that someone MUST have designed it\"\". This is such a perversion of science. You can assign probabilities to something you don't understand. ID is just making up their numbers.    Finally, your example has A->B, where B was deliberate design. that's all well and good for a rigged example, except that with respect to life on earth, \"\"B\"\" is unknown. Your A->B example might qualify as forensic science, if \"\"A\"\" were a dead body and \"\"B\"\" were a bullet in the heart. You see a bunch of dead bodies with bullets through the heart, the next time you see a body with a bullet through the  heart, you can probably figure that's what killed him. You don't have that with life on earth. You have ONE scenario, \"\"A\"\", and you have no other cases to observe or test. So, in that sense, A->B is not scientific if you've never actually observed \"\"B\"\". (btw, B is teh intelligent designer, which has NEVER been observed). So, in that sense, no, it isn't science.  \"\n",
